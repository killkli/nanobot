# Channel Overview

**Channels** are the bridges between nanobot and chat platforms. Each channel connects to a specific instant messaging service, funnels user messages into nanobot's message bus, and delivers the AI response back to the platform.

## Supported Channels

nanobot currently supports the following 12 platforms:

| Channel | Description | Connection Style |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| [Telegram](telegram.md) | Recommended starter channel; easy setup and reliable | Long Polling |
| [Discord](discord.md) | Supports community servers, DMs, and file attachments | Gateway WebSocket |
| [Slack](slack.md) | Corporate chat with thread-aware replies | Socket Mode |
| [Feishu / 飞书](feishu.md) | Enterprise messaging with multimodal input | WebSocket Long Connection |
| [DingTalk / 钉钉](dingtalk.md) | Alibaba enterprise messaging platform | Stream Mode |
| [WeCom / 企业微信](wecom.md) | Tencent enterprise messaging | WebSocket Long Connection |
| [QQ](qq.md) | Official QQ bot platform for private and group chats | WebSocket |
| [Email](email.md) | IMAP polling + SMTP replies for asynchronous workflows | IMAP Polling |
| [Matrix](matrix.md) | Decentralized protocol with E2EE support | Matrix Sync |
| [WhatsApp](whatsapp.md) | Connected through the Node.js bridge | WebSocket Bridge |
| [Mochat / Claw IM](mochat.md) | Claw IM open platform integration | Socket.IO |

## Enabling Multiple Channels

Set multiple channels to `"enabled": true` under the `channels` object in `~/.nanobot/config.json`. When nanobot starts, the gateway listens on every enabled channel at the same time:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN",
      "allowFrom": ["YOUR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID"]
    },
    "discord": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
      "allowFrom": ["YOUR_DISCORD_USER_ID"]
    }
  }
}
```

Start the gateway:

```bash
nanobot gateway
```

All enabled channels run within the same gateway process.

## Channel-Specific Settings vs. Global Settings

**Global settings** live at the top level of the `channels` object and apply to every channel:

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `sendProgress` | `true` | Stream partial responses to channels while the AI is still composing |
| `sendToolHints` | `false` | Whether to surface tool call hints (e.g., `read_file("…")`) to users |

**Channel-specific settings** go inside each channel's subsection. Here is an example that combines the global options with a channel override:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "sendProgress": true,
    "sendToolHints": false,
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
      "allowFrom": ["YOUR_USER_ID"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## `sendProgress` and `sendToolHints`

### `sendProgress` (default: `true`)

When enabled, nanobot streams partial text back to the channel while it is still composing a response. Users see the bot working instead of waiting for the final answer.

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "sendProgress": true
  }
}
```

### `sendToolHints` (default: `false`)

When turned on, nanobot sends a brief hint message whenever it invokes a tool (for example, web search or shell execution):

```
🔧 web_search("nanobot documentation")
```

This helps users understand what the AI is doing, but it is recommended to disable it in quiet mode.

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "sendToolHints": true
  }
}
```

---

## `allowFrom` Access Control

Every channel exposes an `allowFrom` list to control who can interact with the bot:

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `[]` (empty array) | Deny everyone (default—no one can interact until you configure access) |
| `["USER_ID_1", "USER_ID_2"]` | Allow only the specified users |
| `["*"]` | Allow everyone (public mode—use with caution) |

!!! warning "Security reminder"
    Leaving `allowFrom` empty causes all messages to be rejected. Set your user ID before starting the gateway.

## Multi-Instance Deployment

You can keep separate configs for each channel so every instance has its own workspace:

```bash
# Onboard each channel separately
nanobot onboard --config ~/.nanobot-telegram/config.json --workspace ~/.nanobot-telegram/workspace
nanobot onboard --config ~/.nanobot-discord/config.json --workspace ~/.nanobot-discord/workspace

# Start each gateway with its config
nanobot gateway --config ~/.nanobot-telegram/config.json
nanobot gateway --config ~/.nanobot-discord/config.json
```

See each channel's dedicated documentation for detailed configuration options.
